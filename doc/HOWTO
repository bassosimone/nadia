How-To use nadia
````````````````

This tutorial references the file sections.png.

.. image:: sections.png

The content of the XLS file in sections.png is divided into the following
sections:

1. *data_headers*: this is the red section in sections.png;

2. *data_values*: this is the blue section in sections.png;

3. *y_axis*: this is the green section in sections.png;

4. *global_data*: these are the violet, orange, and yellow sections of
   sections.png;

5. *global_const*: these are not shown in sections.png.

For Nadia to linearize an XLS file you need to manually inspect this file
and identify the above sections.  Each section is identifier by the upper left
cell and by the bottom right cell.  So, for example:

* data_headers section is *E3:J5*;

* data_values section is *E7:J12*;

* y_axis is *D3:D12*;

* there are three global_data sections:

  - *Organization* which is *A3*;

  - *WebSite* which is *A4*;

  - *OrganizationMission* which is *A5*.

Assuming that the original file is named `foo.xls`, this leads to the
following configuration file::

  [nadia]
  filename= foo.xls
  data_headers_location= E3:J5
  data_values_location= E7:J12
  y_axis_location= D7:D12

  [global_data]
  Organization= A3
  Website= A4
  OrganizationMission= A5

  [global_const]
  Category= Economic and Business Information

Note that you can add arbitrary constant data, in the *global_const*
section.  For example, in this case, we have added an additional column
named `Category`, whose value is `Economic and Business Information`.

Once you have written the configuration file, you need to invoke nadia.py
as follows in order to linearize the `foo.xls`::

  ./nadia.py foo.conf

(Here we have assumed that the configuration file name is `foo.conf`).
