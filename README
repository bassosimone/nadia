Nadia, helper script for it.ckan.net
````````````````````````````````````

Nadia is an helper script to populate it.ckan.net.  We have a large
data set regarding public section information in Piedmont and in
Italy.  And this data set is composed of a collection of XLS files.
Each file is organized in a tabular way, but the script we use to
upload to CKAN expects a linearized data set.  This is the task of
nadia.

To linearize an XLS file you need to prepare a configuration file
that describes the structure of the XLS file.  Then, assuming the
configuration file is named FOO, you can invoke `./nadia.py FOO'
to linearize the XLS file.  Assuming the original file was named
BAR.xls, nadia will create a linearized CSV output file, which will
be named BAR.xls.nadia.csv.

Nadia depends on Python >= 2.5 only.  There are other dependencies,
but they are shipped together with the nadia distribution and so you
don't need to install any additional package.

Please read doc/HOWTO (or doc/HOWTO.html) to learn how to prepare a
configuration file.
